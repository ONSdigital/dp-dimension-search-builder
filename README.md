# dp-dimension-search-builder

Handles inserting of dimension options into elasticsearch once a hierarchy for an instance becomes available;
and creates an event by sending a message to the kafka `$PRODUCER_TOPIC` so services know when the data has successfully been inserted into elastic.

1. Consumes from the `$HIERARCHY_BUILT_TOPIC`
2. Retrieves the root node of the hierarchy via the hierarchy API, to get the root dimension option
3. Creates elastic search index `/<instance_id>_<dimension>` and adds parent dimension option
4. Retrieves all nodes in the tree below the root node and writing the data to the elasticsearch index
5. Produces a message to the `$SEARCH_BUILT_TOPIC`

## Requirements

In order to run the service locally you will need the following:
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.4/index.html)
- [Hierarchy API](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-hierarchy-api)

Refer to https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-import#dp-import for infrastructure setup of service

## Getting started

* Clone the repo `go get github.com/ONSdigital/dp-dimension-search-builder`
* Run zookeeper and then kafka
* Run elasticsearch
* Run the hierarchy API, see documentation [here](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-hierarchy-api)
* Run the application `make debug`

### Healthcheck

The endpoint `/healthcheck` checks the connection to the database and returns
one of:

- success (200, JSON "status": "OK")
- failure (500, JSON "status": "error").

### Kafka scripts

Scripts for updating and debugging Kafka can be found [here](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-data-tools)(dp-data-tools)
